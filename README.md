Designed for a 2560x1600 resolution but it looks okay in other desktop resolutions such as 16:9 1080p and 720p.

I have not learned responsive web design so this doesn't work on mobile, maybe I could have make some better design decisions with what I already know for this to look as intended in any desktop resolution but I will ask of feedback on this to confirm.
